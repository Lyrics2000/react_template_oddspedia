                                  <h3>How do surebets work?</h3>
                                  <p>Sure bets signals opportunities where a bettor can place multiple wagers on the same sports event and make a profit, due to the differences of prices set by various betting companies.</p>
                                  <p>Also known and referred as "arbitrage betting", "arbing", "surebets", "sure wins", "safe bets" - the strategy of simultaneous buying and selling or backing &amp; laying at an exchange done on favorable payouts - will provide a guaranteed profit.</p>
                                  <p>As we mentioned earlier, what needs to be done is to place a bet on the different outcomes of the match. Done at different bookmakers, the service utilizes the odds discrepancies between those sites to present an arbitrage situation.</p>
                                  <p>Hence why, it's best to be prepared and to have an open account at several bookmakers. And one of the easiest ways to make it work is to cover two potential outcomes.  As a starter in sure betting, picking 2-way betting markets and sports such as Tennis, which doesn't have a draw, will make arbing a breeze.</p>
                                  <p>Sports that don’t have a tie, like tennis, are usually the easiest to make sure bets because you only need to cover two potential outcomes.</p>
                                  <h3>What is the definition of arbitrage betting?</h3>
                                  <p>Arbitrage is a financial method that can also be applied to betting. Here is the official definition in one sentence: "In economics and finance, arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices."</p>
                                  <h3>How to calculate sure bets?</h3>
                                  <p>The easiest answer would be to use a dedicated calculator - like Oddspedia's sure bet calc. After finding a suitable event where the odds payouts are above 100% (guaranteed profit) when taken from different bookmakers - one should split its bet proportionally to guarantee a profit.</p>
                                  <p>Lets take 1x2 market for "Team A" vs "Team B" with 100$ stake as an example - the formula is as follows:</p>
                                  <p>(1/TeamA odds) + (1/Draw odds) + (1/Team B odds) &lt; 1</p>
                                  <p>When this is true we will find ourselves with a sure bet, where we have to decide the total investment. See below:</p>
                                  <p>   <strong>1</strong> (Team A) @8.00 (Bookmaker “A”)<br />   <strong>X</strong> (Draw) @5.30 (Bookmaker “B”)<br />   <strong>2</strong> (Team B) @1.50 (Bookmaker “C”)</p>
                                  <p>(1/8.00) + (1/5.30) + (1/1.50) = 0.125 + 0.188 + 0.667 = 0.98 which is &lt; 2% less than 1.</p>
                                  <p>So lets see how to split the 100$ stake to turn profit :</p>
                                  <p>   <strong>1 </strong>(Team A) @8.00 (Bookmaker “A”) x 12.75$ = 102$<br />   <strong>X</strong> (Draw) @5.30 (Bookmaker “B”)  x 19.25$ = 102$<br />   <strong>2</strong> (Team B) @1.50 (Bookmaker “C”) x 68.00$ = 102$</p>
                                  <p>For the arber, this locks all 3 outcomes to guaranteed 102$ return from our 100$ stake or a 2% sure bet net profit, which we calculated above.</p>
                                  <p>Of course, as we suggested - picking a 2 way betting market or a sport without a draw option makes the matter less complicated. In those cases, you will need less staking calculations to place the arbitrage bets.</p>
                                  <h3>How to find arbitrage bet?</h3>
                                  <p>Bookmakers offer different odds when it comes to a sporting events. As an example, for a football match is quite possible that 1xBet offers the best odds for the home team to win, Betfair offers the best odds for a draw, and Marathobet has the edge for an away win.</p>
                                  <p>Accurate odds are vital for betting companies and while at first, it might seem easy to take favorable prices from various bookies, nowadays such situations are getting harder and harder to find.</p>
                                  <p>So naturally, the best way is to use sure bet scanning software such as the tool found on this Oddspedia sure bets page. Oddspedia scans thousands of events and markets from many bookmakers in order to find suitable opportunities for sure bets. Once you pick the safe bet you want to use the only other requirement is to have an account at the matching bookies and to check the betting limits. <br /> </p>
                                  <h3>What are high sure bets?</h3>
                                  <p>High sure bets refer to sure bets with the most guaranteed payout.</p>
                                  <p>By default, Oddspedia sure bets tool show descending sure bets by profit. Anything above 5% profit margin is considered a high sure bet. Betting on those odds will naturally yield you the most winnings.</p>
                                  <h3>Which are the best advices for successful sure betting?</h3>
                                  <p>The first step is to make sure that you have a betting account with the bookmakers listed for a Sure Bet. Spend some time registering an account and you might even be able to take advantage of a welcome bonus being offered with that particular operator. Once you have betting accounts opened with as many bookmakers as possible, it means that you can start placing sure bets. We recommend starting off with small stakes to make sure you get the hang of arbitrage betting and you’re able to bet on the two or three sides of the betting market. Providing that you place a couple of Sure Bets and make a profit on your outlay, you can gradually start to increase the stake sizes in order to make a bigger overall profit. Sometimes you can find out the maximum stake for a particular bet before going ahead and placing it with that bookmaker.</p>
                                  <h3>What are the possible difficulties when it comes to sure betting?</h3>
                                  <p>First you have to consider the maximum allowed stake for each bookmaker. Because we are usually taking a sure bet profits few percent of the amount staked, it easy to forget about the staking limits looking for bigger payouts. Because we are using larger amounts of money for small returns, we have to make sure that you have all your options covered. Don't expect you can make a €1,000 bet on an outcome for second division league match. Bookmakers set stricter limits to lower division football matches and less popular sports to mitigate risk.</p>
                                  <p>Second, you have to be really quick to place your bet when you see an arbitrage situation. The odds are moving constantly, and a punter has to make sure that he places the correct stakes at all bookmakers at the same time. Otherwise a sudden change in odds may need recalculation of the sure bet stake split, or even losing the arbitrage situation.</p>
                                  <p>Many of the bookmakers don't support sure betting as a fair play. Hence why, it's possible sometimes for a betting company to restrict your account limits. At the end, there is no punter that won't like a risk-free bet, with guaranteed profit on his bets. And bookies are not in the business of giving free money and bonus bets just like that.</p>
                                  <h3>How much money can I make with sure betting?</h3>
                                  <p>The profits will vary based on the initial investment, the amount of betting sites you have account with as well as the frequency of bets you place on certain outcome. Unfortunately, we can’t fully guarantee you will make a profit, or how much exactly, by placing Sure Bets. But we estimated that by using our fast and user-friendly sure betting tool, your winnings may potentially make you more than 20% profit per month. </p>
                                  <h3>Is arbitrage betting legal?</h3>
                                  <p>Sports betting arbitrages are completely legal, well except the case where you are wagering from a country where sports betting, in general, is illegal. The arber only takes advantage of the favorable odds listed at different sportsbooks. With that said - legality is not a problem but bookmakers, in general, do not approve of sure bets made by users and may limit your betting accounts.</p>
